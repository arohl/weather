Get Australian weather from BOM and display in menubar using [BitBar](https://github.com/matryer/bitbar)

The python version uses the [weather-au](https://pypi.org/project/weather-au/) library and can be easily adapted to display any location in Australia by changing the *my_location* variable.

The shell script is much more of a hack and will require significant changes for any locatiuon other than Perth.
